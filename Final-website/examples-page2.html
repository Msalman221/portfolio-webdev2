		<h2 class="examp2">Escape The Loop: The International OCD Foundation</h2>
  <article class="exam">
		  <p class="examp-p"> Escape The Loop is an advertising campaign focused around changing the perception of the overly used term known as OCD. It aims to shift how we think about the term OCD, which is often misused in pop culture to describe mere tidiness. In reality, OCD is a serious mental health disorder characterized by distressing thoughts and repetitive behaviors, typically emerging in teenagers. This campaign cleverly used the pop-cultural language of GIFs, to reflect the repetitive nature of OCD. They flooded <a class="example-link" href="https://giphy.com/IOCDF/escape-the-loop" target="_blank">GIPHY</a>  with images of typical compulsive actions. This initiative seeks to correct misconceptions and support youths in breaking the cycle of OCD early on.	</p>

			<ul class="conceptss">
				
				<li> <strong><u> SIGNIFIER:</strong></u> Spreading the awareness of early signs of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and encouraging those who experience OCD behaviors to seek help in time.</li>


				<li> <strong><u> SIGNIFIED:</strong></u> The actors used in the GIF/constant loop commercials were expressing common OCD behaviors and signs, that our society mistakes for everyday normal things.</li>


				<li> <strong><u> SYMBOL:</strong></u> All the looped GIFs in this advertising campaign showed the most common early-stage OCD/compulsive behaviors. However, they also let every loop carry a hidden message. For example, at the beginning of each GIF, you see a person perform an action, either opening a door multiple times, turning on the stove multiple times, or picking at their nails. When first looking at these GIFs, one may find it hard to understand the meaning behind them. But shortly after each character performs these repetitive actions, it's met with large bold/highlighted text that explains how the actions performed in each of those GIFs is a common trait of OCD. For instance, one of the advertisements visually showed how a common trait of OCD is repetitive and intrusive inner thoughts, another showed how a common trait of OCD is repetitive checking. When first looking at these GIFs it may seem confusing, but after you learn the meaning behind- them and see the call to action message with the International OCD Foundations website link and resources, one can now understand what the meaning of these advertisements is. </li>


				<li> <strong><u> DENOTATION:</strong></u> The literal meaning behind this advertising campaign wants to show that OCD isn't a 'quirky personality trait' or an entertaining term used to describe orderly people. It's a serious- mental illness. The purpose behind this campaign was to change the perception around the stereotyped term and to also help suffering youths break the vicious cycle of OCD, at an early age.</li>
				

				<li> <strong><u> CONNOTATION:</strong></u> The symbolic and emotional meaning of this campaign was to visibly show how OCD is a serious mental disorder. It causes people to suffer from intensely negative and intrusive thoughts, as well as repetitive actions. The denotation of this campaign was to correct the stereotyped term of OCD and show that it's a real mental illness. The connotation behind this campaign is showing those who may have signs of OCD or suffer from it, how it's not a very glorified experience like others are communicating through social media. Seeing people self-diagnosing on social media about having random anxiety or health disorders makes those who heavily use these platforms easily influenced, and gullible to serious misconceptions of real disorders, diseases, and health concerns. With TikTok and social media as a whole glorifying OCD, it leads people who show these signs of the disorder to feel that they just have a cool adjective to describe themselves. But, when these people have this incorrect information about a very real mental disorder, it defers them from seeking the help and treatment they need in a very time-sensitive situation.</li>


				<li> <strong><u> METAPHOR:</strong></u> The very name of the campaign, "Escape The Loop," is a metaphor itself. It expresses how people overuse social media and technological entertainment services. Escape The Loop was made through GIFs in constant loops, showing repetitive actions that define OCD and show behaviors to look out for. While Escape The Loop can also mean escaping the constant use of social media and technologies in so much of our everyday lives. It also means escaping the loop of OCD, and knowing what signs/behaviors are actually OCD, and not just what TikTok and other social media platforms may have told you. </li>


				<li> <strong><u> CODES:</strong></u> The social structures that shape our behavior, concerning this advertising campaign, are those we see through social media. Since the 2020 pandemic, many youths and young professionals relied on TikTok or Instagram as their main source of entertainment, news, and education. We're going through a time where people are self-diagnosing themselves from one TikTok video made by a young adult who has no professional or educational experience in the fields that they are talking about. This leads many to be easily convinced into something that has no fact-checking or real professional insight. This all explains how OCD, now more than ever, is a term that is commonly used but not commonly understood. Thanks to our social structures through social media, we often associate OCD as an adjective or just a 'quirky' person who happens to like things clean or organized.</li>
				

				<li> <strong><u> INTERPELLATION:</strong></u> This advertising campaign was made for those who may have signs or behaviors of OCD, to interpellate these commercials and take action. With each of these GIFs visually showing repetitive actions and behaviors that people with OCD commonly experience, it activates people who have the disorder's mirror neurons. Seeing these repetitive actions in front of them, makes them lean more into it because they recognize the sign that is being performed. And can easily align themselves with it, as they have performed the same actions almost their whole lives. That's why at the beginning of each GIF, they have the actor portraying the basic behaviors of OCD, then shortly after, explaining through text on the screen how this behavior is a common trait of OCD. They then provide a call to action link for you to see further if you may- have the disorder, and how to go about it. Since I am a person who has been diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder, I can confidently say that I interpellated this whole advertising campaign. Also, I felt a deeper emotional connection to it, because I knew that they were talking to me. This can explain why I chose this campaign for my semiotic analysis because this campaign spoke to me and aligned with who I am.</li>


				<li> <strong><u> IMAGES:</strong></u> In this advertising campaign, they used a specific logo that shows an orange infinity sign with the words "Escape The Loop" inside it. This visual gives the audience another mental representation of this campaign's whole message, Escaping The Loop. The infinity sign used, is to serve as a representation of how those who suffer from OCD who are untreated, are going through this constant infinite loop of repeating actions, again and again, intrusive inner thoughts, repetitive checking, and so on.</li>


				<li> <strong><u> ICON:</strong></u> In this advertising campaign, the International OCD Foundation and Ogilvy Denmark purposely used GIFs and the website GIPHY, as their primary means of communication. They did this because their target market uses GIFs, social media, and short repetitive loops, as a way of communicating and entertaining. With the target market being very familiar with GIFs and these social means of communication, they can now be nudged into recognizing early signs of OCD, helping them Escape The Loop, one GIF at a time.</li>

	<p class="ad-expl">Ad Agency VSA partnered with the iconic Kleenex brand to create a campaign that would help with the brand's declining sales and eroding meaning. After looking into the target segment, they found a rich emotional dimension that the brand had an opportunity to capture. This campaign wasn't about what's in a Kleenex box; it was about what's in the consumer's heart. </p>
