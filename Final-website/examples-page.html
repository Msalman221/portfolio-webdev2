		<h2 class="examp2">Dove Real Beauty Sketches | You're More Beautiful Than You Think Campaign</h2>
  <article class="exam">
		  <p class="examp-p">Dove Real Beauty Sketches is an advertising campaign where they produced a short film and corresponding <a class="example-link" href="https://www.dove.com/us/en/stories/campaigns/real-beauty-sketches.html" target="_blank">custom hub website</a> as part of the Dove for Real Beauty marketing campaign. The aim of the film is to show women that they are more beautiful than they think they are by comparing self-descriptions to those of strangers. They hired a real FBI sketch artist to sketch these descriptions. The results found that the sketches drawn based on the descriptions of the other women were more beautiful and accurate than the ones drawn based on self-description. This campaign highlighted the unrealistic beauty standards in society and how they can negatively impact the way women perceive themselves. This ad is considered evergreen content, meaning its message and relevancy can never fade overtime, this campaign was made back in 2013, and its message is still just as powerful more than a decade later.</p>

				  <h2 class="conceptv">Semiotic Concepts Within the Ad:</h2>
			<ul class="conceptss">
				
				<li> <strong><u> SIGNIFIER:</strong></u> The women who were asked to describe their physical features to the sketch artist, and we're all giving inaccurate and self-deprecating depictions of themselves, which led the sketch artist to draw an unrecognizable person.</li>


				<li> <strong><u> SIGNIFIED:</strong></u> Not only Dove's brand essence but specifically the Dove "You're More Beautiful Than You Think" Campaign.</li>


				<li> <strong><u> SYMBOL:</strong></u> When these women were asked to describe themselves you would hear them say things like, "I have a fat rounder face," or "I've been told by my mom all my life that I have a very long pronounced chin." However, when total strangers were asked to look at other women and describe to the sketch artist what they look like, they said very positive natural descriptions. Such as, "She had nice eyes. They lit up when she spoke and were very expressive." In these examples alone you can see the symbolic meaning behind this commercial is that we are so critical of ourselves and our appearances, that we often lose sight of what we REALLY look like in real life. </li>


				<li> <strong><u> DENOTATION:</strong></u> The literal meaning of this commercial is to show women how they are more beautiful than they think. And they need to stop self-loathing their looks and beauty, from either- things they may have been told while growing up or just their own inner battles within themselves. </li>
				

				<li> <strong><u> CONNOTATION:</strong></u> Underneath the literal meaning of this commercial, is the process in which Dove is pushing the idea of self-confidence, comfort in one's own skin, positivity in natural beauty, and becoming aware of how society has viewed female standards of beauty. Yes, the literal meaning of the Ad is to show that "you're more beautiful than you think," but you see the connotation when these women look at the images of themselves that were drawn from a stranger's perspective. You can see these women's faces lighting up when realizing how they are being so hard on themselves, and that they should start learning to be more confident in their own skin. This is something that this campaign doesn't specifically note, but is the underlying meaning that is implied.</li>


				<li> <strong><u> METAPHOR:</strong></u> A metaphor from this advertisement would be the metaphorical 'filter' that we put over our self-image. This 'filter' distorts the real version of our beauty, with insecurities, society's unrealistic beauty standards and expectations, and every bad thing that you may have been told about your appearance in your life. This metaphorical filter gets thicker and thicker with each negative feeling or thought we have about our own physical appearance. And as you can see in this commercial, each person who was describing themselves had this filter blocking them from seeing what everybody else sees.
				</li>


				<li> <strong><u> CODES:</strong></u> The social structure regarding the unrealistic expectations of one's appearance is shown in this Advertisement. Our society shapes the behavior of this Ad through the unrealistic societal definition of what is 'beautiful' or 'desirable' when it comes to one's appearance. In today's world, we are subject to constantly comparing ourselves to others, especially through social media. These comparisons leave people with insecurities and self-destructive feelings toward their physical appearances. </li>
				

				<li> <strong><u> METONYMY:</strong></u> You see metonymy a lot in this advertisement, specifically in the responses of those who were asked to describe a stranger. These people used certain phrases and words that attributed to beauty to describe a person, for instance, when somebody stated "her eyes are a beautiful blue, like an ocean." This statement shows that this person who was describing a stranger saw her for her beautiful features. When the same woman had to describe her own eyes, she stated that they were, "brown like almost the color of shit." These are two very different representations that describe one person's eye color. The contrast in these two- representations can show how each individual can look at the same exact sign, and come up with two completely different descriptions of what it is. It really is in the eyes of the 'reader' (who in this case, is the stranger describing another person's beauty to the sketch artist) to interpret how they perceive and accept the sign that is in front of them.</li>


				<li> <strong><u> IMAGES:</strong></u> The images or representations that are contained in this advertisement, are the visual and mental representation of just how different our perception of our own beauty is from the perception of others. You see this in the advertisement where they compare the two different drawings made by the sketch artist. One of them was the actual realistic sketch that looks more like the person being described, while the other looks like somebody almost unrecognizable. Finding out that the stranger's version of the sketch turned out to be the more realistic one, proves how self-bias can change the very perception of a sign.</li>


				<li> <strong><u> AUTEUR THEORY:</strong></u> Dove has been known as the brand of positivity and self-empowerment since the early 2000s. This advertisement is nothing far from their normal content. A lot of Dove's advertisements, messaging, and very brand essence, are about bringing back the more realistic side of not only beauty, but life in general. And putting it in an advertisement so that people can start to not only accept, but interpellate. Dove has a variety of commercials such as, "Curly/Afro Natural Hair Journey," "Baby Dove Under Pressure Postpartum," and "Beauty On Your Own Terms #MyBeautyMySay." You can see from these commercial titles alone that these are representations of how Dove communicates its brand essence.</li>


				<li> <strong><u> RECEPTION THEORY:</strong></u> The video ad itself was a very out-of-the-box creative idea to convey the message of embracing your beauty. But the audiences' reaction to this advertisement made it even more powerful. The commercial now has over 12 million views and has been referenced/ shared in multiple women's empowerment and body positivity campaigns for the past five years. This advertisement was able to successfully convey the message that they were trying to send not only to their customers but to people in general. Part of the reason why the audience embraces this commercial so much is because Dove didn't try to stray from the target concept at hand. You see in a lot of advertisements where companies try to convey a message such as this one, and in the end, relate it back to a product. This leads the audience to believe that the advertisement may not have been as sincere as it claimed to be. But with this- seven-minute-long Dove commercial, not once did they mention a body wash, product, or even a link to go onto their website. This advertisement was solely meant to be taken as an empowering message to all and to convey Dove's values, and purpose as a brand.</li>

This campaign wasn't about what's in a Kleenex box; it was about what's in the consumer's heart. </p>
