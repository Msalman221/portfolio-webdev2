  <article>
		  <p class="synop">Kelsey was able to offer a distinct perspective on semiotics, from a psychological POV. She offered some scientific explanations for how/why consumers are affected by what they see. She did this by describing the role that mirror neurons play in how consumers perceive and react to advertisements, explaining how these neurons are activated by various sensory experiences, enhancing our social and cultural understanding. Kelsey also provided some examples from her work, including a campaign where semiotics were used to evoke nostalgia and trust, tailored to the target audience's psychographics. She also discussed current trends in consumer behavior, predicting a shift towards more personalized and engaging advertising through sound. This interview further strenghtended my understanding of the scientific foundations of semiotics and their application in advertising.</p>

			<ul>
				<li> Kelsey's expertise was evident throughout our interview. She explained how semiotics influence consumer actions, highlighting the importance of advertisers being able to reach their target audience effectively. During our conversation, Kelsey emphasized that<strong> <em>"semiotics serves as the language of advertising." </strong> </em> </li>
				
				<li> She stressed the role semiotics plays in deciphering the hidden meanings conveyed through symbols and visuals and how things like mirror neurons play a role in our understanding as self-aware beings. Kelsey explained that mirror neurons <strong> <em> "can serve as a scientific explanation for how we as humans are able to elaborate on social skills, networks, and the knowledge we call culture through the experiences of ourselves and others around us."</strong> </em> </li>

				<li>After asking Kelsey about how these mirror neurons are 'activated'/used when a consumer sees an advertisement, she described how our mirror neurons <strong> <em>"go under fire when we either see, hear, touch, taste, smell, intuit, or witness something happening in front of us, something that we are doing ourselves, what we see on TV, or hear on the radio." </strong> </em> </li>

				<p>NOTE: Learning the role that mirror neurons play helped me significantly understand the scientific/mental explanations for how using semiotics effectively works in advertising.</p>
				
				<li>Based on her experience, Kelsey shared an example of using semiotics in ads from when she worked with advertising agencies as an expert consultant. Kelsey stated, <strong> <em>"In a campaign for a household brand, which I can't name at the moment for NDA reasons, we employed cues specific to the target market's psychographic data and beliefs to trigger nostalgia and trust." </strong> </em> </li>

				<li> <strong>What Kelsey's Interview Shows Us:</strong> My interview with Kelsey included real-life examples and professional explanations that helps illustrate how semiotics can influence consumer perceptions and behaviors. She highlighted more of the psychological and scientific explanations for semiotics, like mirror neurons, and how our brains can subconsciously understand what an advertiser is trying to convey through hidden semiotic concepts.</li>
