  <article>
		  <p class="synop">Trinity shared her perspective as a consumer, furhter emphasizing how semiotics in advertising captures attention subconsciously. She described an experience with a TikTok ad that cleverly used a scene from her favorite TV show, <em>New Girl, </em> to keep her engaged. This instance illustrated the powerful role of familiar visuals and symbols in advertising, resonating with discussions on mirror neurons from Kelsey's interview, showing how they trigger consumer engagement. Trinity also discussed the ethical implications of such advertising strategies, emphasizing the need for honesty and transparency in advertising, a sentiment also strongly shared by Gen Z. Additionally, Trinity gave us a POV from the average consumer and how they have concerns about privacy with targeted ads on platforms like TikTok and Instagram, highlighting the fine line between effective marketing and invasive practices. This final interview with Trinity provided valuable insights into consumer reactions to semiotics and raised important questions about ethical and privacy issues in advertising/marketing.</p>

				  <h2 class="quotes">Key Findings/Quotes From the Interview</h2>
			<ul>
				<li> As we started the interview, I mentioned my interest in exploring how hidden symbols influence advertising efforts, aiming to comprehend how people interpret and react to cues in ads. Trinity shared her thoughts, mentioning how she always found it intriguing how advertisers used familiar symbols, visuals, and sounds to communicate messages or actions. She recalled an example from earlier that day before our interview, where she was looking through her TikTok feed, and a random advertisement popped up while she was scrolling. She explained,<strong><em>"Usually, as soon as I see the 'eligible for commission' or 'paid sponsorship' button underneath a TikTok, I scroll immediately. But there was something about this ad for this facial cream that made me keep watching. It wasn't until later that I realized the girl in the ad was wearing the same outfit and essentially reenacting a scene from one of my favorite episodes of New Girl. I didn't even know at the time that that's why I was still interested in it, but I knew that there was something really familiar and weird about that ad." </strong> </em> </li>
				
				<p>NOTE: Her observation was a great example of how things like semiotics, or what Kelsey mentioned in my second interview about mirror neurons, can cause a consumer to become more interested or engaged with an advertisement based on familiar things they enjoy. </p>

				<li> <strong>What The Above Bullet Shows Us: </strong> Trinity loves the TV show <em>New Girl.</em> However, she doesn't know every single outfit or scene from the top of her head. But when she saw that TikTok ad, she knew something was familiar, which made her stay on the ad instead of scrolling immediately like she usually does. <strong>Something was activated somewhere deep in her unconscious that told her to keep watching. This shows how the use of semiotics can change a consumer's behavior and actions-further proving it to be a powerful force in the advertising industry. </strong> </li>
				
				<li> Trinity shared her views on advertising, voicing concerns about using strategies to sway consumer behavior, stressing the need for truthful marketing approaches.<strong> <em> "I value brands that are honest about their products and avoid unethical practices just to make a sale." </strong> </em>  Trinity's view on advertising is much like everyone else's in Generation Z.</li>

				<p> <strong>GEN Z's VIEW'S ON ADVERTISING: </strong> Gen Z is tired of being misled or lied to by advertisers/anyone around them. Especially with influencer marketing and advertising today, it's almost like you always have to question or worry about everything you see or hear. As a hidden message may trick you into buying something.</p>

				<li> <strong>What Trinity's Interview Tells Us:</strong> My interview with Trinity provided a great real-life example of how semiotics works in advertisements. One thing that many often need to remember in advertising, is that sometimes advertisers do not always measure the success of an ad based on people who immediately purchase the advertised product/service. We also measure it based on things like increased brand awareness, perception, and word of mouth. Using the first bullet point as an example, Trinity was able to recall this advertisement in detail; she effectively spread the meaning and message of that advertisement to someone who had never actually seen the ad themselves. Her reaction proved that the advertisement was successful, while also demonstarting the power of semiotics in advertising. </li>
