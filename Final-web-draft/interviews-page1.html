Our discussion covered the ethical implications of advertising, stressing the necessity for authenticity and transparency in establishing brand loyalty. This interview with Jorden not only enhanced my understanding of semiotics in advertising but also emphasized its critical role in effective marketing strategies.</p>

				<li> I asked Jorden about some of the campaigns where they believed that they used semiotics, they mentioned how, <strong> <em>"In one fun memorable campaign for our P&G client, we strategically used things like color psychology to evoke feelings of trust and reliability in the in-store ads. This was important to us because that is Tide's message that they want to communicate to consumers. So when we incorporate things like warm tones or familiar imagery, we are able to establish a sense of familiarity and comfort with our desired target audience." </strong> </em> </li>
				
				<li> One of the key takeaways from my interview with Jorden was Jorden's perspective on how semiotics and consumer psychology work hand in hand.

It also reminded me that just by understanding the nuances of semiotic elements, can help advertisers effectively build connections with their desired target audience for their select client's ask, further fostering things like brand loyalty and engagement for their select client.</li>
