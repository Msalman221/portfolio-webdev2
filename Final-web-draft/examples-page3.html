  <article class="exam"> 
	<p class="examp-p">The Functional Becomes Emotional campaign was created to answer the iconic Kleenex brands problem of the brand's declining sales and eroding meaning. After looking into the desired target segment, they found a rich emotional dimension that the brand had an opportunity to capture. They transformed the Kleenex brand from a mere "sick box" to a symbol of care. Their research showed that millennials and moms value altruism and a compassionate world for their kids. So, they reframed Kleenex as not just a thing you use when you're sick, but as a gesture of kindness. The campaign "<a class="example-link" href="https://vsapartners.com/work/kleenex" target="_blank">Someone Needs One</a>" highlighted how a simple tissue can deepen personal connections, showcasing that true humanity is expressed through empathy, openness, and thoughtfulness. </p>

				  <h2 class="conceptv">Semiotic Concepts Within the Ad:</h2>
			<ul class="conceptss">
				
				<li> <strong><u> SIGNIFIER:</strong></u> The commercial examples of people in different scenarios/situations, where one could use a Kleenex in a happy/emotional way, and not a sick one.</li>


				<li> <strong><u> SIGNIFIED:</strong></u> The Kleenex brand, specifically, with their new brand approach and tagline "Someone Needs One."</li>


				<li> <strong><u> SYMBOL:</strong></u> When first looking at the many advertisements for this campaign, the very beginning of each commercial didn't seem like a Kleenex product commercial at all. If you were to see these commercials without any context and no background knowledge of who made them, you may be very confused as to what the commercial was getting at, or its purpose. In most of the commercials, you don't see any of the actors using the product, or alluding to it, until the last few seconds. It's only then, that you see the Kleenex sign off with their tagline, "Kleenex, Someone Needs One." After seeing their sign-off and rebranded tagline, the audience can now understand the whole meaning of the commercial.</li>


				<li> <strong><u> DENOTATION:</strong></u> The literal meaning behind this advertising campaign was to rebrand the iconic Kleenex box from being the face of Cold and flu commercials to being a brand that focuses more on the consumers' emotions and personal values. Kleenex has been seeing a continuous decline in sales for over 15 years. Kleenex was also losing the very meaning of its brand, it had become an empty vessel in a sense. It was a brand with high awareness and had been around for a long time, but limited emotional resonance particularly with, moms and millennials. So, Kleenex asked the Advertising Agency, VSA Partners, to make a campaign that would intrigue this target market, and drive Kleenex sales back up. VSA Partners had came up with a campaign that, "turns sniffling into a moment to care about." All in order to have the target market empathize and connect with the brand, so they would not only see the other uses for Kleenex but also appreciate the brand itself. </li>
				

				<li> <strong><u> CONNOTATION:</strong></u> The symbolic/emotional meaning behind this advertising campaign was to show Kleenex as a brand that focuses on the consumers' hearts and drives. Kleenex wanted to use commercials that had to do with equality, mental health, chivalry, heartwarming stories, and friendships. They used all of these examples to be able to show how Kleenex can be used in almost every situation in your everyday life, while also showing their support for all of these diverse stories of personal connection.</li>


				<li> <strong><u> CODES:</strong></u> In our society, the use of a tissue, usually had to do with being sick, having runny noses, or even clearing up bad tears. Though one could use tissues for good tears/moments, our society never thought of that as a common/obvious use of the product with Kleenex heavily marketing itself as the "cold/flu helper" since the birth of the brand. Year after year, the brand started to diminish in value as well as in sales. This is why Kleenex sought out VSA Partners to make a re-branding effort, that would change the social structures which shaped the target markets' behaviors towards the Kleenex brand.</li>
				

				<li> <strong><u> INTERPELLATION:</strong></u> Kleenex made dozens of short commercials that aligned with their new re-branded values and meaning. Why? So they could reach not only their target market, but anybody who could've empathized or felt an emotional connection to one of the many commercials they made. All of the commercials they created fall under the same campaign but are completely different in regards to the actual plot. Kleenex's target market was moms and millennials. They chose various diverse stories of personal connection, that they knew millennials would be able to interpellate. By Kleenex making various diverse commercials, they not only guarantee that their target market would be able to interpellate them, but they also made it possible for those outside of their target market to interpellate.</li>


				<li> <strong><u> IMAGES:</strong></u> The various scenarios of people using Kleenex for happy tears and bringing people together. For example, one commercial talked about a gay couple who found out their marriage was annulled, because of a problem with the county's court system. Kleenex then helped host their new wedding, where they made a sculpture-like message out of Kleenex boxes, which wrote out, "Love Always Wins" in tissue. In this one commercial example, you can see how the whole campaign depends on using different scenarios that anybody can possibly relate to, find moving, or have an emotional connection with. All in order to see the uses of the Kleenex brand in a happier light.</li>
