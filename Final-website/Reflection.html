<p class="flect">The topic I chose to center my final project around was the power of semiotics within advertising. When I started my final project, I was really curious about how deep the influence of signs and symbols runs in the advertisements we see every day. I started with the idea of uncovering hidden layers in popular advertising campaigns and ended up discovering how essential these semiotic strategies are in connecting with audiences.</p>

<p class="flect">I interviewed three individuals who could offer insight into my topic, two of whom were industry professionals, including an advertiser and a psychologist. Going into these interviews, I half-expected semiotics to be a somewhat overlooked aspect, maybe even taken for granted. Instead, I found that these professionals not only recognized its importance but actively incorporated semiotic analysis into their work strategy. This was a major shift for me. It differed from my initial assumption that the significance of semiotics might be overlooked by those who actually create the advertisements.</p>

<p class="flect">This project has reshaped how I view the world around me. Now, every advertisement, every billboard, and even street signs seem to carry a deeper message, intentionally crafted through semiotics. This new lens has made me more analytical of the media I consume daily, especially as a person going into the advertising industry.</p>

<p class="flect">Creating the website for my final project was as educational as it was challenging. I chose a design that would make the information pop, strategically using bright colors and ensuring the layout was pretty straightforward. My overall goal was to encapsulate my findings and educate others about the powerful influence that semiotics hold in the advertising realm. </p>

<p class="flect">The coding side of building my final project website presented its own fun set of challenges. It was a very detailed process involving multiple HTML pages, each requiring a lot of coding and design edits. My computer's crash was a tough hurdle since it deleted the most recent versions of my final website's code. Still, it gave me a huge lesson on the importance of regular backups, a lesson I learned the hard way, but am guaranteed to remember for all future coding projects. Something I would do differently in the future is try to simplify coding formats and elements I used, to not only save time when building my website but also safeguard my project against potential technical issues, like the ones I faced near the end of my project. </p>

<p class="flect">On the bright side, this experience helped me further strengthen my coding skills that I had learned in this class throughout the semester. I'm genuinely proud of how the website turned out. It's not just a showcase of what I've learned; it's a resource for others to understand the impact of semiotics in advertising, how it influences consumer behavior, and how it's woven into the digital/physical fabric of our everyday lives. </p>

<p class="flect">All in all, this project has taught me a lot about the power of semiotics in advertising, blending psychology, technology, and advertising practices into an integrated learning experience. It made me really interested in how psychology plays into marketing/advertising strategies. It taught me a lot of valuable things that I can't wait to use in future projects when I start working in the advertising field.</p>
